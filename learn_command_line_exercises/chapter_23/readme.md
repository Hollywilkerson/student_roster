#DO MORE
##Explain the following commands:

xargs - execute arguments. Often it is used in conjunction with a pipe operator.Where many commands cannot execute long lists of arguments
without crashing. xargs splits lists into sublists and then executes the command on to sublists.

sudo - super user do. Allows the user to run certain commands as the "super user" or any other user. It is used to bypass certain restrictions placed onto the current user.

chmod - change modifier permissions. Allows the user to change the read/write/execute permissions of a file.

chown - change owner. Allows the user to change the owner or group of a file. This can possibly lead to more file permissions going to a certain user/group if they didn't have them previously.

#Alternative "english" ways of asking for your working directory:
##Let's close this terminal and open a new one.
I would type 'exit' within the terminal and that would exit me.
Then I would use spotlight and type in "Iterm" to open a new terminal!
         
##Can you reload your terminal?
You wouldnt be able to "reload" it.
You would type 'exit' and then just reclick the 'iterm' icon in your dock.
Or while you are in iterm you can go up to the tab "SHELL" and either open a new window or new tab. 

##Can you logout?
You would just type 'exit
