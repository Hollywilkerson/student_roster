# Can you make a temp directory?

Yes, you can make a temp directory.You would just go to whatever directory you want to
add the temp directory in and you would use the command 'mkdir' and type in the name you want to
create for the directory. for example I would be in
 cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/chapter_4     and then while i was in the directory
chapter_4 directory  i would type
'mkdir temp'
and it would create a directory within the chapter_4 directory called "temp".
I would then cd over to the directory called temp by typing
'cd temp' and I could once again
create another directory within that directory called stuff. i would type the command
'mkdir stuff'
then change to the new directory called stuff by typing the command
 'cd stuff'
This would create a path of directories....
I could also do it a quicker way and make a path from the beginning and make multiple temp
folders within the chapter_4 directory. I would start here at this path...

cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/chapter_4
type:

mkdir  - p chapter_4/temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex/
john/holly/sally/blah/etc


and this would created multiple directories within that path.


Both these ways would create directories within directories within directories. :)

# Can you make a log directory in your class directory?

yes you would just go to the class directory on your command line and you would type
'mkdir log'
 and it would create a log directory within the class directory.

I would be in the path of  cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016
and i would  type the command 'pwd' to make sure I was in the class directory
 called "davinci_coders_t1_2016" and if i was i would type
'mkdir log'
 It would then create a directory called "log" within the class directory.
