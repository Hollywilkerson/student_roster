#Alternative "english" ways of asking for your working directory:

##Can we see what's in our production log?
Yes you would just start in the path of where your "production log" is at..
In this case I was in the following path...
/Users/hollywilkerson/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_11/log
The I typed....
'less production.log'
you could also type
'more production.log'



##What does our database.yml look like?
When viewing it from less, we are prompted to an editor. However, 
when we do more, nothing happens.



#Do More
##Open your text file again and repeatedly copy-paste the text so that it's 50-100 lines long.
I started in the path of...
/Users/hollywilkerson/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/
learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_12      (this is where I copied the ex12.txt file to earlier from desktop)
I then typed in 
'mine .'
This opened Rubymine .. I selected the file I wanted to add to, so I clickedon
"ex12.txt"
I highlighted my previous line one input and did a 'command, C'
then returned down and did a 
'command v' and hit 'return' 
I completed this process over and over on each line to copy and paste this throughout the entire document.  

##Copy it to your temp directory again so you can look at it.
I'm going to start in the path of the desktop to copy it again to the temp folder...
Users/hollywilkerson/Desktop
I am going to type:

'cp ex12.txt /Users/hollywilkerson/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_12/temp'
Now to look at it again we are going to type
'less ex12.txt'
We use 'q' to quit.
'more ex12.txt'
Again, q to quit. (Spacebar and w to scroll before quitting)
