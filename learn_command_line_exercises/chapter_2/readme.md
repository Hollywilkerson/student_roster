# 1)What directory are you in?
chapter_2.....  I ran the pwd command.

# 2)Are you in the class directory?
im still in the chapter_2 directory, the class directory is part of my path to get to the chapter_2 directory. If I wanted to be in the class directory i would type "cd .." and it would take me back one directory which would be the class directory.    I ran the pwd command to figure this out.


# 3)Are you in your home directory?
I am still in the chapter_2 directory...The home directory is part of my path to get here though. The home directory is called hollywilkerson. I would just put "cd ~/" to get back to the home directory.
I ran the pwd command.

# 4)What directory did you run that command in?
I was in the chapter_2 directory when i ran the pwd...
I was in that directory since I just made that directory for this assignment.
I ran the pwd command.

# Explain how you would find the readme.md file using the graphical filer browser
In order to find the path for finding my readme.md file using the graphical filer 
  browser you would click the finder icon in the bottom
left corner of your computer. Then you would click the home directory on the 
left hand side in the grey area. From there you would go into the "workspace" folder
In the "workspace" folder you would then click the "davinci_coders_t1_2016" folder
Then you would click the "Chapter_2" folder we created... and you would find the
"readme.md" file for this project. :)
