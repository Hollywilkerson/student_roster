#Do More
##Make a few more text files and work with cat.
###Make ex12.txt and ex13.txt
You could make these files two different ways..
From the terminal, while you are in the path of...
/Users/hollywilkerson/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises
/chapter_13/tmp
you will then type:

'touch ex12.txt'
'touch ex13.txt'
This will create two blank files within the tmp directory we already made.

Or you could open Rubymine by typing
 'mine .'
and then clicking on the tmp directory you have created and type
'command n'
and select you want to add a new file and name it "ex12.txt"
then once again click on the tmp folder and type 
'command n'
and select you want to add a new file and name it "ex13.txt"
Then you type whatever you want in the documents to save.

Then you can start typing 
'cat ex12.txt'
and it will show you whats inside that folder
and you can look whats in the other folder by typing
'cat ex13.txt'
You could also type
'cat ex12.txt ex13.txt'
and it will show you whats inside both of the files :)
