# Explain what the command ls does 
'ls' lists out the contents of the directory you are currently in. While you are in a 
 directory you can type in the command 'ls' and it will list whatever is within that directory
 It will list off which directories are available to go to next.  Whenever you are lost
 you can type in 'pwd', which will tell you what directory you are currently in, and then
 you type 'ls' and you can see the list of options for what path you want to take next.
 
#What does the ls-lr command do?

are in as well as the files/folders in that directory.
 

# Alternative English Ways:

# What's in the tmp directory?

If you were within the directory called "tmp"  you would just type the command 'ls'
This would then give you a list of what is within that directory tmp. In this case
it lists off the directory called "stuff" since we created that earlier. 


# Can you show me what files are in that directory?

Yes whatever directory you want to see what's inside you will cd to that directory by typing:
 'cd directory name'
and then type the  command 'ls'
 and it will list off all the files and directories within that directory.
