# Explain what the pushd and popd commands do in your own words:

The 'pushd' command saves the current working directory in memory so it can
be returned to at any time, optionally changing to a new directory. 
The 'popd' command returns to the path at the top of the directory stack.
"popd" pops the stack, removing the top item (i/like/icecream) and letting 
the next item (~/temp) pop to the top of the stack, becoming the new working directory.
popd, like pushd, shows the stack on its side, with the top of the stack on the left 
and the bottom of the stack on the right.

# Explain to me what directories you went through in order to get to the readme.md
In order to get to the readme.md for this chapter I was within quite a few directories.  I was within a path of quite of few directories.  I was within the home directory... the  workspace directory, the class directory which is called davinci_coders_t1_2016.
Then I was within the directory called homework... and  the learn_command_line_exercises directory ... and within the chapter_8 directory...
