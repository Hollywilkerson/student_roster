# Questions:
# What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
The three most essential skills that a beginning programmer needs to know is reading and 
writing, paying attention to detail, and spotting differences.

# Please explain these three skills in your own words.
Programmers need to make sure they are attentive. They need to be able to observe and notice
detail. They need to be able to recognize differences fairly fast and make the changes as needed.
They should have reading and writing skills as well.  



# Why do you need to not copy and paste?
If you copy and paste, you are not getting the practice that you need. You are going to need to
practice over and over in order to train your brain, hands, and your mind to read, write,
and see code.



# Why is Practice and Persistence important?
Practice and Persistence is important because that is the way we learn. It gives you Repetitive
practice, which over time will make what was difficult before become easier. If you focus on 
slowly improving and enjoying the learning process, then you will benefit from it and it will
eventually just "click" on day. The author says with programming there's this very odd thing 
that happens. At first, you will not understand anything. It'll be weird, just like 
with learning any human language. You will struggle with words, and not know what symbols are.
It'll all be very confusing but then one day your brain will snap and you will
suddenly "get it."
